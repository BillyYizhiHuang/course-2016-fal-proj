#Goals for the Project
Optimize access and coverage to public transportation by changing bus stops and routes
Determine a stable bus schedule given information about traffic (Google maps API/NextBus)
how can we coordinate with bus and T stops/commuter line/hubway by linking different systems together 



#Bus Data Sources 

For current bus data
*	Bus stops (Boston Maps Open Data)
*	Bus routes (Open Street Map?)
*	Number of buses + mbta ridership data (MBTA Bluebook)
*	Real time next-bus api (NextBus API scraping / google drive) 
	*	Mbta bus location data (for a few weeks)

For modeling 
*	T-stops (MBTA API)
*	Commuter rail stops (MBTA API)
*	Hubway locations (hubway)
*	Neighborhood census data (MassGIS)
*	Traffic Incidents i.e. Jams, Accidents (Waze, 311)
