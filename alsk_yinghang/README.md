# Project #1
## Data Sets
We will be using the following data sets:
* Crime Incident Reports
* Streetlight Locations
* Police District Stations
* Food Pantries
* Property Assessment

The purpose of using these datasets is to figure out which factors influence crime. This then be used to predict high crime areas and what could to be done to limit the problem. 
Food Pantries along with Property Assessments will provide an overview of the affluence of different neighborhoods, whereas Streetlight locations will show which areas are under-lit compared to others. The locations of Police Stations will help further paint an image of a given area. 
This can then be compared to the locations of different crimes, to see how the different factors we considered compares.
