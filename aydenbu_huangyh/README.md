##Summary
In this project, we've considered the relationship between the avg income and the number of some kind of public buildings (Hospital, School, HealthStore and Public Garden). The analyze is based on the zipcode.
 
##Datasets
The five datasets we used:
<ol>
<li>'hospital_locations':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/u6fv-m8v4.json'</li>
<li>'employee_earnings_report_2015':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/bejm-5s9g.json'</li>
<li>'health_corner_stores':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/ybm6-m5qd.json'</li>
<li>'community_gardens':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/rdqf-ter7.json'</li>
<li>'public_schools':'https://data.cityofboston.gov/resource/492y-i77g.json'</li>
</ol>

##Porcess
Firstly we can obtain the number of average earnings in each zipcode area by using MapReduce to project and reduce to get the total earnings and counts in each zipcode, then we can obtain the average earning by (total earning divides counts) for each zipcode area.

Secondly we can obtain number of hospital, number of garden, number of store and number of school group by the zipcode by applying the simple MapReduce Function.

Combining all datasets generated by the second step, we obtained a num of these building grouped by the zipcodes. 

Lastly, we merge the previous dataset with the average earnings dataset to obtain a dataset that contains the number of these buildings and average earning using zipcode as unit.
