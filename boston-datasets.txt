The goal is to apply some of these techniques to the data sets(including integrated or derived data sets) and solve practical problems. Some of the problems raised in discussions with the City of Boston DoIT and MassDOT teams are:

    characterizing intersections and coming up with a metric that incorporates:
        intersection throughput (people per unit time),
        modes of transportation (public transport, biking, walking),
        intersection safety (vehicle speed, accidents, and so on),
        intersection organization (no left turns, and so on); 
    characterizing streets and deriving metrics for:
        number of parking spaces,
        probability of an accident (e.g., using different modes of transportation),
        senior and handicapped mobility;
    characterizing neighborhoods:
        economic condition and gentrification,
        senior and handicapped accessibility;
    how to allocate resources to optimize some of the metrics above:
        where to perform repairs,
        how to improve housing affordability,
        where to place bike racks of ride sharing stations,
        senior and handicapped accessibility;
    answering immediate questions relevant to an individual (e.g., in an app):
        is a building accessible,
        is there a place to park (or will there likely be at some other time),
        is a neighborhood safe (or is it becoming less or more safe),
        is a neighborhood affordable (or is it becoming less or more affordable),
        are healthcare services nearby.
    integrating public transportation data with other data (e.g., Waze):
        why are buses on a certain route late,
        performance and problems during unexpected events (e.g., snow).

The above list is far from complete, and we will update it as the course progresses. Students are encouraged to discuss project ideas with faculty and one another.
