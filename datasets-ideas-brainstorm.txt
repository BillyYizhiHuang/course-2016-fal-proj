Think of it as a cell/living organism?

What matters to people?
Beauty/Cleanliness
Entertainment
Safety
Access to infrastructural resources - time and location
Economic advantages
Carbon Footprint...?
Social Climate

___ that has the most/least ___
e.g. "Areas that require the most maintenance"

...Locations that are most likely to have people notice something wrong...? -- or rather, not wrong, but wrong relative to their perceived norm...
Areas that are the most hurried...?
	- Hmm, correlation between areas of leisure/entertainment and crime
Hmm, dispersal of government buildings and associated crime around such areas
Dispersal of government buildings and places in need of service requests
Planned areas for contractors and crime rates
(wow, all having to do with crime)
...Areas that have the strongest sense of "community"...?
	- Contrasting indicators of "community" with areas of "entertainment"
		- Even more interesting metrics one can do with that -- economic correlation with such areas? 
		- Crime correlation with such areas? 
		- Service request rate with such areas?
		- Building/Property Violations? 
		- Food Establishment Inspections?
		- Dispersal of government buildings in relation?
		- What are the rates of crime/conflict along lines between two distinct "areas" with strong "community"?
		- Carbon footprint/waste produced? (and combined with the notion of "trash" -- how well-lit areas are, for a total sense of "cleanliness")



What are indicators of community?
	- Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Pickup Locations
	- Public Access Fishing Locations
	- Local Food Distribution (but does this go to retail stores or to local businesses?)
	- Urban Orchards/Fruit Trees (in and around city of Boston)
	- Community Gardens (throughout Boston)
	- Food Pantries (food banks/pantries in Boston, accurate up to 2012)
	- Year-Round Swimming Pools/Seasonal Swimming Pools
	Now which of these are pretty STRONG indicators of community? (i.e. less touristy and more maintained by those who live close by)
		- Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Pickup Locations
		- Year-Round Swimming Pools/Seasonal Swimming Pools
		- Public Access Fishing Locations (kind of)
	
What are indicators of entertainment/anti-sense-of-culture?
	- Liquor Licenses + All Section 12 Alcohol Licenses -- but what about bars...
	- Nail Salon Permits
	- Boston Taxi Data
	- Active Food Establishment Licenses
	- Issued Moving Truck Permits
	- Entertainment Licenses
	Now which are pretty STRONG indicators of a lack of community?
		- Issued Moving Truck Permits
			*- Boston Taxi Data (this is in a weird format)
		- Density of one of the following:
			- Active Food Establishment Licenses
			- Entertainment Licenses
	
(Public Works Active Work Zones? -- where would that go?)

(get later: Issued Moving Truck Permits)
So my datasets (for now):
- Issued Moving Truck Permits
- Active Food Establishment Licenses
- Entertainment Licenses
- CSA Pickup Locations
- Swimming Pools
- Public Access Fishing Locations

Three new datasets:
- Crime locations based on a set circle-radius of how close it occurred to a number of locations (with anti-community indicators)
- Ditto (with community indicators)
- Crime locations across moving truck permits
OR 
- Find neighborhood zones and group neighborhoods with the number of community indicators, 
- anti-community indicators,
- and crime



####Project 1####
a)	Choose at least five publicly available data sets, data streams, services, or documents (note that some of your data sets 
may have similar schemas and may contain similar information, but all five data sets cannot have very similar schemas 
or very similar information). Write a short narrative and justification (5-10 sentences) explaining how these data sets 
can be combined to answer an interesting question or solve a problem. You do not need to solve the actual problem in this project, 
and it is acceptable to merely combine data sets in a way that is likely to support one or more solutions involving the particular data 
you choose. Include this narrative in a README.md file within your directory (along with any documentation you may write in that file).

b)	Implement algorithms that perform at least three non-trivial transformations that merge, combine, or otherwise process some 
of the five data sets into three new data sets. These new data sets should be inserted into the repository. You can choose one of 
the existing algorithms or tools we have considered so far, or something else (assuming you thoroughly document in your README.md file 
how to obtain and run those tools).

c) 	Commit and submit a pull request.
