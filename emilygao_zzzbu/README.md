Project proposal 

#2.a)
We decide to combine the following data:
  Boston Public Schools:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Boston-Public-Schools-School-Year-2012-2013-/e29s-ympv>
  Employee Earnings Report:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Finance/Employee-Earnings-Report-2015/ah28-sywy>
  Corner Stores:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Corner-Stores/4vcu-nshu>
  Active Food Establishment License:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Active-Food-Establishment-Licenses/gb6y-34cq>
  Hospital Locations:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Health/Hospital-Locations/46f7-2snz>

We will use the combination datasets to answer the question whether the specific street is clean or not base on the cleaning and recycle schedules. Moreover, the streets with hospital and restaurant and the places which have the property record are more likely to produce trash. As a result, we can use these datas to solve the question whether the street is clean or not.
