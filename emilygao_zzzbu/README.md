Project proposal 

#2.a)
We decide to combine the following data:

  Boston Public Schools:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/dataset/Boston-Public-Schools-School-Year-2012-2013-/e29s-ympv>
  
  Employee Earnings Report:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Finance/Employee-Earnings-Report-2015/ah28-sywy>
  
  Entertainment License:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Entertainment-Licenses/qq8y-k3gp>
  
  Active Food Establishment License:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Active-Food-Establishment-Licenses/gb6y-34cq>
  
  Hospital Locations:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Health/Hospital-Locations/46f7-2snz>

We will use the combination datasets to answer the question of whether the people with higher earnings would like to live in the place with more public services or not. Hospital, public school, entertainment place and the active food establishment are all public service which can show whether that area is busy or not.
