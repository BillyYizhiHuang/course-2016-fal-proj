Project proposal 

#2.a)
We decide to combine the following data:
  Street Sweeping Schedules:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Street-Sweeping-Schedules/755x-x44q>
  Trash Schedules By Address:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Trash-Schedules-by-Address/cich-iivi>
  Master Address List:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/City-Services/Master-Address-List/t85d-b449>
  Active Food Establishment License:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Active-Food-Establishment-Licenses/gb6y-34cq>
  Hospital Locations:<https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Health/Hospital-Locations/46f7-2snz>

We will usse the combination datasets to answer the question whether the specific street is clean or not base on the cleaning and recycle schedules. Moreover, the streets with hospital and restaurant and the places which have the property record are more likely to produce trash. As a result, we can use these datas to solve the question whether the street is clean or not.
