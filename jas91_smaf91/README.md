# Project 1

We chose to combine datasets holding the following data: [Crime], [Schools], [Hospitals], [Food Establishment Inspections], [311] reports. An interesting project would be to rate a given zipcode based on the quality of itâ€™s surroundings. 

Most of the datasets have the zipcode included, along with the latitude and longitude, but some others have only the last two. We decided to incorporate a sixth dataset including [zip codes] with its corresponding coordinates. In this way, we think, it is possible to approximate each record to a zip code.
