Narrative:

       The five datasets are employee earnings in Boston, location of public schools in Boston, location of police stations in Boston, crime incidents in Boston and education levels in the US. These datasets can be combined on location to see various statistics relating to crime in different counties of Greater Boston area. Specifically, we want to see the presences of schools and police departments on the occurrences and different crimes. Also, we want to see if there is a correlation between education/wage and general crime in an area. These questions are interesting because politicians often point to increasing education or security as ways to improve living conditions.
