# Project Proposal

We are proposing to answer the question of whether or not a neighborhood/address is safe. Users will be able to enter either a neighborhood or a street name and our program will return data regarding overall safety of the area. This includes how well lit an area is, the crime rate (including specifics about the crime), overall cleanliness of the area, and upkeep of the area. In order to do this, we would use the ?Master Address List? dataset and return data that is relevant to the area. We would output data in a way that makes it easy for an average citizen to get an idea of how safe an neighborhood is.
